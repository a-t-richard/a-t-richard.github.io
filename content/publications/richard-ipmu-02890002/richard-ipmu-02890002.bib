  abstract = {In collaboration with the Civil Hospitals of Lyon, we aim to develop a 'transparent' classification system for medical purposes. To do so, we need clear definitions and operational criteria to determine what is a 'transparent' classification system in our context. However, the term 'transparency' is often left undefined in the literature, and there is a lack of operational criteria allowing to check whether a given algorithm deserves to be called 'transparent' or not. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a definition of 'transparency' for classification systems in medical contexts. We also propose several operational criteria to evaluate whether a classification system can be considered 'transparent'. We apply these operational criteria to evaluate the 'transparency' of several well-known classification systems.}
