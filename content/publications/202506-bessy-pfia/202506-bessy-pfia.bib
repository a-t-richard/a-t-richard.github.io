  abstract = {In this article, we propose two approaches for multi-label
diagnosis from chest CT images. The first, called Seg2Clf,
leverages the latent space of the encoder from a pre-trained
segmentation model to extract discriminative representations
for classification. The second approach relies on the
extraction and integration of clinical radiomic features, allowing
prediction refinement using a k-NN classifier. These
two complementary methods are part of a broader strategy
aimed at developing automated systems capable of simultaneously
identifying multiple thoracic pathologies with
improved accuracy.}
