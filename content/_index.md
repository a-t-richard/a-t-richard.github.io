My name is Antoine Richard, PhD in computer science.

My PhD was made in collaboration with Hospitals of Lyon (HCL)
on clinical decision support systems, their applications, impacts
and limitations.

Today, I am still working with the HCL as Research Engineer,
at the _Centre pour l’Innovation en Cancérologie de Lyon (CICLY)_,
on projects including Artificial Intelligence.
 
I’m currently interested in Artificial Intelligence development and application
in Healthcare contexts, such as: Natural Language Processing of medical reports,
Computer Vision on CT Scans, and analyses of clinical data in general.
In addition, I’m also interested in connected subjects such: as Patient Privacy,
Ethics of the Algorithms, eXplainable AI, and more recently AI Environmental
Sustainability.
