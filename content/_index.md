My name is Antoine Richard, PhD in computer science.

My PhD was made in collaboration with Hospitals of Lyon (HCL)
on clinical decision support systems, their applications, impacts
and limitations.

Today, I am still working with the HCL as Project Manager, 
on projects including Artificial Intelligence.
 
I’m currently interested in Machine Learning in sensible contexts,
such as the Healthcare context, and in Ethics of Algorithms. 
(even if Multi-agent systems keep a special place in my heart and
if the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm stays my favorite algorithm).
