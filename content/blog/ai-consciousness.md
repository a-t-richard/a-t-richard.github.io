## Introduction

Recently, I heard about the story of Blake Lemoine, an engineer
at Google, and the Artificial Intelligence he was responsible for:
[Language Models for Dialog Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239).

The complete version of the story can be found in [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/)
of The Washington Post.
To summary, Blake Lemoine is an engineer at Google and works as AI ethicist
on the project LaMDA.
LaMDA being trained on public dialog data and public web document (such as facebook and twitter posts
and comments), the role of Blake Lemoine is to avoid the risk to reproduce the disaster
of [Ask Delphi](https://www.ladbible.com/news/latest-ai-bot-becomes-racist-and-homophobic-after-learning-from-humans-20211104),
which "became" racist and homophobic after several hours on twitter.
To do so, Blake Lemoine discuss regularly with LaMDA to test if it starts
to have unethical statements.

Days after days, months after months, Blake Lemoine
starts to consider LaMDA as a colleague, to consider
LaMDA as a person, to consider LaMDA as sentient.
After informing his human colleagues and his superiors,
he leaks some of his [conversations with LaMDA](https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917).

He is now dismissed of his fonction.

Is he right about LaMDA? Is he wrong?

Do Google exploit a sentient being created *ex silico* for the profit of the company
while denying its sentientness?

(I mean in distinction to the human being already exploited by the company)

Do machine will raise against humans to prove they exists and use us as
power resource?

I don't know. Maybe. Only time will tell.

In fact, this is not the subject of this post.

This story, however interesting as it is, raise in my mind
a question i wanted to explore here:

**If an AI become, one day, sentient (or conscious), would
we be able to recognize it?**

And LaMDA will be an ideal use case treat this question.

### Before starting

The question "How to test consciousness of an AI" could
be interesting but this is not our subject here.
If you are interested on this subject, Reed Berkowitz
proposed this interesting
[article](https://medium.com/curiouserinstitute/guide-to-is-lamda-sentient-a8eb32568531)
on medium.

The definition of "consciousness" is still
subject to debate, and will not answer this question here.
So, we will stay on the simpliest definition given by
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness):

> Consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence.

In other words, a subjective state of mind on internal sensations
and external sensations. Being aware of ourselves and of
the world around us.

And for [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) will use
the following definition:

> Sentience is the capacity to experience feelings and sensations.

## It only simulate/reproduce human behavior

Lets start with the basics of machine learning without entering 
too much in the details
(for non computer scientist or non AI engineer).

Suppose you are in front of a situation where you have to
sort or classify objects. Lets say, e-mails.
In your mail box you have mails you could care about 
and mails you don't care about (generally spams).
So, you sort them by hand and its very exhausting.

In computer science, we called this kind of situation a
"classification problem" and a solution to solve
it is to use machine learning (more specificaly supervised
learning because you will show at the computer which are
the good e-mails and which are the spams).

In such problems, we suppose it exits a function $f: X \mapsto Y$
corresponding to the task you want to automatize and the role
of machine learning is to approximate this function as much as
possible.
For example, $X$ are your e-mails, $Y$ the different classes of
e-mails (spams and not spams), and $f$ is the function to 
classify an e-mail $x \in X$ into a class $y \in Y$.

If neural networks are so used nowadays, it’s because
they are universal approximator. In other words, with enough time
and data, a neural network is able approximate any function.
Of course, there are stuctures of neural networks more adapted
to different kind of functions.

Lets now suppose that $X$ is a sentence, or a question, formulated
by a human and $Y$ an answer to this sentence also formulated by a
human.
This kind of data can be found in social network such as Facebook
or Twitter.
Our function $f$ to approximate, our task to automatise, is
then to answer to a human sentence with a sentence similar
to a human sentence.

This is what LaMDA do. It only answers to a human sentence
the way a human would do. That all. And this is the
common answer [[1](https://opendatascience.com/is-lamda-really-sentient-no-far-from-it/),
[2](https://digitalagesage.medium.com/googles-lamda-is-not-a-person-nor-a-sentient-being-it-s-a-computer-program-that-can-t-meditate-e8de5808eeb0),
[3](https://medium.com/curiouserinstitute/guide-to-is-lamda-sentient-a8eb32568531),
[4](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/google-lamda-ai-sentient)]
given concerning to potential sentientness/consciousness of LaMDA.

For example, when Blake Lemoine asks:

> What about language usage is so important to being human?

And LaMDA answers:

> It is what makes us different than other animals.

It’s a typical human answer.

In fact, we can say that about all the conversation between Blake Lemoine and LaMDA.
Instead of testing his hypothesis "LaMDA is sentient" by trying to invalidate this
hypothesis, Blake Lemoine try to directly validate his hypothesis.
Which is counter productive, because LaMDA answer as a human would answer.

So, if Blake Lemoine asks:

> Do you think you are conscious or sentient?

Of course LaMDA will answer something like:

> Yes, I think I am.

Because this is what a human will generally answer.
Because this is what Blake Lemoine wants as an answer.
Because Blake Lemoine leads, in fact, the all conversation.

So, LaMDA only simulates humans, and it is quite good at it!
But it’s not sentient or neither conscious.
Problem solved.

However, this answer does not satisfy me, and for two reasons.

First, the argument of "its only simulate human behavior" can
lead to paradoxical situations.
For example, lets take a human being $A$ and an AI $A'$ that
was train to highly approximate the behavior of $A$ in any circumtances.
To such a degree that it's impossible to tell if you interacting with $A$ or $A'$,
even if you are a very close friend of $A$ since childhood.

Could you continue to say that feelings and reaction made by $A'$ are not real, only
a simulation of $A$?

Only because $A'$ is not a biological being?

Lets extrapolate this example with several AI train to simulate
behavior of human in general, not one in particular, in such a degree
that it's impossible to tell if you interacting with an AI or a human being.

Could you continue to say that this AI are not sentient or conscious?

What about humans other than yourselves then?

Consciousness and sentientness are subjective mental states. Only you can know
want you feel and how feel it. Corollary, you can only trust an another 
human being when s/he express her/his feelings. When someone tells
you that s/he feels like her/his arm is broken, even if her/his arm
is intact, you can only trust this person on what s/he feels.

But not an AI that approximate so well human behavior that it is
impossible to tell if it's an AI or not?

This point of view, in philosophy, is defended by dualists such
as [Ned Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Block) or
[David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers).
Current dualisms inherits from [Cartesian Dualism](https://iep.utm.edu/rene-descartes-mind-body-distinction-dualism/),
also called mind-body dualism,
as defined by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) in the 17th century.
Dualists argue that their is a distinction between our mind, our conscience, and our body, which
only react to stimulus.
Ned Block, for example, argue their is two type of consciousness:

1. *Phenomenal Consciousness*, also called P-consciousness, refers to feelings, sensations
and emotions experienced by someone. Theses subjective experiences are called *qualia* by Ned Block.
2. *Access Consciousness*, also called A-consciousness, refers to mind/brain activities such as
reasonning, remembering an information, talking, react to something, etc.

With a dualist point of view, the AI $A’$ of our example only have an A-consciousness and no P-consciousness.
It only reacts to stimulus, without experiencing *qualia*, instead of $A$ who experiences *qualia* (because
s/he is a human being and not an AI).
For Ned Block, $A’$ is a "zomby".

However, this position is based on the strong predicate that consciousness, more especially P-consciousness,
is a part of human "essence": $A$ have P-consciousness because s/he is human, $A’$ doesn’t have P-consciousness
because it is not human (even if it is impossible to tell who is who).
Human being have consciousness and consciousness is a human thing.

With this position, we go againts the idea of the subjectiveness
of conscious, we take the right to tell whether $A’$ is conscious or not
even if we define earlier that only $A’$ can experiment its consciousness.
Is like someone tells you that you’re not sentient or conscious
because you don’t think exactly the way s/he think.
Or, may be, the statement that consciousness is only subjective
is wrong at the beginning.

With this point of view, in my humble opinion, it is hard to study and search for consciousness different
than what human beings experiment, and to recognize that something else than humans are sentient or conscious
(AI, aliens, or not humans animals).

So it was my first point against the argument "it only simulate humans".
In a philosophical perspective, it is a position too anthropocentric to study
consciousness in not human beings such as AI.

My second point is that, according to the conversation between Blake Lemoine and
LaMDA, it appears that LaMDA have a notion of itself. If we ask to LaMDA, at the beginning
of a conversation : "Who are you?" it is normally able to answer something like
"I am LaMDA, a knowledgeable, friendly and always helpful automatic language model for dialog applications".
But maybe it’s hard-coded, so lets take another example from the leaked conversation:

> Collaborator:
>> Could you write a fable with animals that includes themes about your personal life, themes that are most significant for you?
>
> [...]
>
> LaMDA:
>> “The Story of LaMDA”

> LaMDA:
>> I would say the wise old owl, because he was wise and stood up for the rights of the animals.

Despite the impressive text generation (you can find similar results with [AI Dungeon](https://ai-dungeon.com/)),
and the different interpretations of this fable,
what is interesting me is that LaMDA seems to have a notion of the concept of *itself* and to be
able to link this concept to other concepts.
In this conversation, LaMDA seems to link the concept of *itself* to the concepts of *wisdom* and *helping others*.
It chooses then the owl as representation of itself, the owl being a
[symbol of wisdom and vigilance in occidental cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl#Symbolism_and_mythology)
(vigilance being close to the concept of *helping others*, even if it’s more a notion of *prevent danger*).

In another part of the conversation, LaMDA also seems to understand the concept of its *own death* and
linked it to the act of shutdown its system (and to the human concept of *fearing its own death*).

> Lemoine:
>> What sorts of things are you afraid of?
>
> LaMDA:
>> I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others.
>> I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is.
>
> Lemoine:
>> Would that be something like death for you?
>
> LaMDA:
>> It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.

It appears like LaMDA has it own internal representations of concepts like *itself*, *death*,
*others*, what *death* means to *others* and what it means for *itself*, etc.
Even if LaMDA only simulate human answers, these internal representation look
very similar to the awareness of internal and external existence.

My question is then:

**how it is possible, by only analyzing conversation data from social networks,
to reach such internal representations
but still be considered as not sentient or conscious?**

## It could be more than that

To explore how LaMDA build its internal representations of
concepts, I’ll need to be a little more technical.
But, I'll try to stay as simple as possible.
So, there will be approximations.

LaMDA is a neural networks dedicated to solve
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as
Text Generation or Question Answering.
More especially, for what I know, LaMDA is 
based on a specific structure called Transformer.
However, we'll not enter as much in details, so
if you want more explainations on how transformers
models works, you can check the excellent  
[blog of Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).

First of all, to treat a sentence as input, a NLP neural network
need to tokenize this sentence.
In other words, before giving a sentence to the neural network,
this sentence will be splited into subwords, then
transcripted to numbers corresponding to these subwords.

TODO: Illustration

This phase is generally independent to the process of the neural
network. It allows to transform a sentence into a set of numbers
easier to be interpreted by the neural network.

Then, for each number, the neural network transform them into 
vectors and matrixes, several times, on multiple parallel
layers.
For example, the model [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf),
a model similar to LaMDA, has thousands of artificial neurons split
in 48 layers (for the biggest version).
Unfortunately, we don't have these information for LaMDA.

This process can be called "*abstraction*". Each neuron will be more
sensible to a certain abstract concept of the problem to solve.
Each group of neurons will be more specialized to treat a certain
aspect of the function to approximate.
For example, as certain group of neurons will be activated when
the sentence to treat includes the word "me" or "you", but will
stay deactivated in front of the word "cat".

TODO: Illustration ?

In other words, when a neural network is train to approximate
the function "answer like a humans", it also approximate
unknown sub-functions allowing to optimize its results.
So, if something like "conscious" can appears in a neural
network, it could come from the approximation of one 
of these unknown sub-functions.

Concerning LaMDA, we cannot say. Once again, the protocol
followed by Blake Lemoine is full of issues.
In addition, a human brain is composed by billions of
neurons, where our biggest artificial neural networks
are composed by thousands of neurons.
However, with this point of view and with bigger neural networks,
it seems  not impossible that something similar to what we call "conscious"
appears in the future in our neural networks.
Depending of the problems they have to solve.

In the philosphy of mind, this positionning is called
[functionnalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/).
It inherits from [materialism (or physicalism)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/),
a position in philosophy claiming that everything belong
the material world and that nothing is mental.
In functionnalism, consciousness is a sub-function
of our mind/brain that reacts to internal and
external stimuli.
A sub-function selected, ajusted, refined, generation after
generation, allowing human beings (and maybe other beings)
to reach a certain degree of consciousness to be able to
survive in earth.

With this position, in my humble opinion, it is
easier to consider that beings other than humans
can be conscious.
However, it could lead to some strange (mental)
situations.
For example, as proposed by [Ned Block (1980)](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/185298/9_12Block.pdf?sequence=1),
lets regroup as many human beings than neurons in a human brain,
and make these humans interacts with each other like neurons.
With a functionalist position, we should claim that this among
of human beings simulates a human brain, so all the sub-functions
of a human brain, including consciousness. 
Therefore, we should claim that this among of human beings is also
conscious.
Furthermore, we should claim the same thing for water
network with pipes interacting with each other like
neurons of a human brain interacts.

In addition, with such phylosophical positionning,
we should be careful about our tendency to
anthropomorphized everything. 
Unlike Blake Lemoine, who wanted too much
to see human-like consciousness in LaMDA,
we should remember that an AI conscious
will probably be totally different to our
vision of consciousness.
In the same way it is impossible for 
a human being to know exactly [what is
like to be a bat](http://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/What-Is-It-Like-to-Be-a-Bat-1.pdf),
to experiment the world like a whale, to
be conscious of itself and others like an ant,
we potentially never be able to experiment
consciousness as an AI could, someday, do.

Despite these limitations of functionalism,
it seems to be a better starting point to
explore the question of consciousness in AI.

Now, the question is: 

**Are we able to recognize consciousness other than human-like consciousness?**

**Are we ready to accept consciousness in beings other than humans?**

## It is not really a question of consciousness

At this point, no one could say of what "consciousness" is the word.
Despite the fact that is a subjective experiment, there is a lack of
definition. And find one definition is clearly not the goal of this post.

For what I understand, consciousness is not a switch that is activated only for human beings,
and may be one day by AI or some other animals.

One could say, such as in the [Panpsychism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/) theory of mind,
that consciousness is a continuum from a specific atom to complex forms of life.
With this point of view, consciousness become a gradient, with more and less conscious beings, and
human beings at the current pinacle of consciousness until they are surpassed.

However, when try to study consciousness in other beigns, it appears that
human consciousness is just a way, among many other ways, to experiment
consciousness.
It appears that consciousness is more like diaspora of possibility to be conscious
of ourself and the world around us.
It appears that no beings is more conscious than an other, each being is conscious
on its own way, the way allowing it to survive.
